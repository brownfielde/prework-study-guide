# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This assignment served as an introduction to the basics of coding through an interactive project that culminated in the production of a study guide website, which actively helped with familiarizing oneself with certain aspects of working. In this assignment, I learned about the basics of HTML, git, CSS and JavaScript, as well as the many accompanying programs used by developers on a day to day basis. In the end, I learned a wealth of new information that has made me look forward to the upcoming class.
